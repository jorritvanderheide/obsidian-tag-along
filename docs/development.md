# Development

## Setup

```sh
nix develop     # or any Node.js 20+
npm install
npm run dev     # rebuild on change
```

To try it in a vault, copy or link `main.js`, `manifest.json` and `styles.css`
into `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/tag-along/` and reload Obsidian, or turn the
plugin off and on again.

## Checks

```sh
npm test        # vitest
npm run lint    # eslint, with the Obsidian plugin's rules
npm run build   # type check and production build
npm run bench   # see Performance
```

CI runs the first three on Node 20, 22 and 24 for every push
(`.github/workflows/lint.yml`).

## Tests

Tests are in `tests/`, one per file in `src/core/`, named after it, plus
`settings.test.ts`. See [Architecture](architecture.md) for why nothing in
`src/ui/` has one.

## Releasing

1. Bump the version: `npm version <x.y.z>` updates `manifest.json` and
   `versions.json`.
2. Push the commit and a tag named for the version, without a `v`, to Codeberg.
   That is the only remote: GitHub mirrors it.
3. When the tag reaches GitHub, `.github/workflows/release.yml` builds it,
   attests `main.js` and `styles.css`, and creates a **draft** GitHub release
   with them attached.
4. Publish the draft. Obsidian's community directory installs from GitHub
   releases, and a tag alone is not one.

Before releasing anything that changes how settings are stored, see
[Settings](settings.md#changing-the-shape).

## Updating an action

The workflows pin every action to a commit, with the version in a comment, so a
tag that is moved later can't change what builds a release. Nothing updates
them automatically, so look at them before a release. To move one to a newer
version, look up the commit the tag points to and replace both the hash and the
comment:

```sh
gh api repos/actions/checkout/commits/v6.1.0 --jq .sha
```

Both workflows also default to read-only. Only the release job asks for more:
writing the release, and signing the attestation.
